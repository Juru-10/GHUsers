**TRIANGLE TRACKER**

*Author*:**Assumpta Uwanyirijuru**

**Project description.**
an application that will help to know whether a triangle is isosceles, equilateral, scalene or NOT a triangle at all.

Based on the functionality of the application, key points to note are:

For an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal.
For an isosceles triangle, two sides are exactly equal.
For a scalene triangle, none of the sides is equal.
However,
the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side.
Most importantly,
if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side,
then a triangle CANNOT be formed using those values.
(For example, the values 9,4 & 3 cannot form a triangle.)

**Setup instructions**
- includes any scripts that need to be run if necessary.

**BDD.**

**Behavior
Our program should handle:**
1.to compare the sum of two sides of the triangle to the third side,
2.to compare the triangle's sides lengths,
3.to know if all sides are equal,
4.to know if two out (of three) sides are equal,
5.to know if none of the sides is equal to another,
**Input Example
When it receives:**
1.two sides sum greater than the third,
2.length values of the three sides of my triangle,
3.the equal values of the first, second and third sides,
4.the equal values of two sides but not equal to third,
5.all values different,
**Output Example
It should return:**
1.whether it is a triangle or NOT a triangle at all.
2.type of triangle my values will produce.
3.equilateral triangle.
4.isosceles triangle.
5.scalene triangle.

All user stories are achieved.
The project accurately detects an equilateral, scalene and isosceles triangle.
It also accurately detects if a triangle CANNOT be created.

Project is well polished in a portfolio quality state.
The project is well designed, very visually appealing,
easy to work through the website, shows a touch of creativity.
This also means it goes above the visual aspect with features
like clearing form fields after an event and so much more.
